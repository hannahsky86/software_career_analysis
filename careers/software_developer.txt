This team is headquartered in Lehi, Utah but is primarily distributed around the world. Remote work is a possibility but some preference is given to local candidates.

Travel is occasionally but rarely required.

Virtues You Should Have:

Kindness and empathy

Working on open-source software is fun and challenging but also requires the ability to understand other people’s concerns and understand their needs. You need to be able to listen first and ask good questions.

We have a team with a wide variety of experiences and backgrounds. You should be able share yours and help out when other people are less experienced in an area you’re an expert in.

Respect

Respect for other people and their needs. We want you to have a very healthy respect for diversity and inclusion in your belief and in practice.

You should have some experience with open-source software and with fast-moving and very active projects.

You should have an understanding of SaltStack, as either a developer or a user but ideally as both. A good candidate will come from either a development background or an operations background, but a great candidate will have worn both hats. You’ll have a healthy appreciation for automation that borders on obsession.

We like people who can talk about how large systems are managed in the real world and about what works and what doesn’t. You should be able to give a solid history of where systems management has been and you should have a well-informed opinion about where it should go.

Salt manages a wide variety of technologies, including support for many public and private cloud providers. You should know your way around AWS and understand how things like Docker and Kubernetes operate. You should know the fundamentals of systems management across a range of areas, from init systems to managing DNS.

You should be able to review code and suggest areas of improvement.

We don’t have a hard requirement for experience but most people who have the needed skills have been doing this for five years or more.

Finally, you should understand software packaging, especially for Python packages and you should be able to assist with creating releases and getting them out the door on schedule.

Work Environment:

You’ll experience development within a horizontal corporate structure, and be under the guidance of managers who encourage your personal growth while providing valuable feedback.

We operate by hiring smart people and then letting them do their jobs. Ours is a highly collaborative environment where ideas are encouraged and all voices are appreciated. We’re inclusive, diverse, and forward-thinking. And, since we know you’re not a robot, we respect your personal time.

What we do

Our current stack is Vertx, RxJava, Gradle, Docker, Kubernetes, Postgres, and RabbitMQ in a microservices environment. We champion autonomy, innovation, accountability, and above all, our customers. On average we release to prod a couple times a day (over 2,000 total releases in 2018!). 

What you'll do

You'll work on an autonomous squad with another back-end dev and a couple of front-end devs. Your squad also has a dedicated product designer, product manager, and QA engineer. From start to finish, you'll work together to design and build products that revolutionize the professional tax industry. You will have opportunities to research new technologies, learn, grow, mentor, and be mentored.

We are currently building out new squads that have complete ownership over a new product to be released in 2019. Ask us in your interview what specific team you'll be on and what you'll be building!



What we look for

We look for candidates with senior-level experience who enjoy the latest Java has to offer. We look for experience in developing real-world web applications that scale with users as well as features.

About You

You take personal ownership seriously and drive excellent outcomes for your team and all stakeholders. You strive to become a master of your craft and to build the best software. You enjoy providing technical leadership and mentoring. You make your team and the organization stronger through collaboration and effective communication.
You value continual improvement at all levels: personally, as a team, as a software platform, and as an organization. It doesn’t matter to you where the best ideas come from, or how they evolve into solutions through innovation and collaboration. You value being agile much more than doing Agile. If bugs escape you treat it as a learning opportunity for you and the team.
You are candid and objective in your interactions with your colleagues. You give and accept feedback that benefits individuals, teams, the organization, and ultimately customers. You also understand the benefits of code reviews and give and receive them graciously.
You keep customer experience in mind in all that you do. You value quality and employ best practices to deliver correct solutions that are maintainable and reliable without being over-engineered. You are willing to take part in an on-call rotation.
