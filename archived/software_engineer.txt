Salt Lake City, UT
Forcepoint is transforming cybersecurity by focusing on what matters most: understanding people’s intent as they interact with critical data and intellectual property wherever it resides. Our uncompromising systems enable companies to empower employees with unobstructed access to confidential data while protecting intellectual property and simplifying compliance. Based in Austin, Texas, Forcepoint supports more than 20,000 organizations worldwide. For more about Forcepoint, visit www.Forcepoint.com and follow us on Twitter at @ForcepointSec.

We are looking for a Senior Java Engineer with 10+ years of relevant experience to join our analytics team in either our Salt Lake City, Utah or our Baltimore, Maryland office. The primary function of the role is to help design and implement components for the core analytics engine of our platform. You will work alongside engineers, leads, and product owners to plan, scope, and execute and, as a senior member of the team, will be looked towards as a thought leader and technical advocate.

About us

While Forcepoint has many products, the focus for this position is working on our User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) product, which is responsible for collecting and analyzing the digital exhaust that users produce (web logs, communications, logins, etc) in order to detect illegal, unwanted, or harmful behavior.

The Salt Lake City office is located in the Old Mill district in Salt Lake City, in close proximity to Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. The office building has many amenities including: exercise facility, walking/running paths, and covered parking. Within a few minutes walk, employees have access to several restaurants as well as other conveniences that make the location a pleasure to work in.

The Baltimore office is conveniently located in the Federal Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Cross Street Market (which is, sadly, currently being renovated) and only a few blocks from the inner harbor. We are close to many restaurants and stores, and employees in this office receive free, off-street parking. Our office has a large personal reflection room set aside for private use, is very close to the sports stadiums (we plan on taking a day off to watch an Orioles game soon), and its open floor plan helps to support our family-like atmosphere.

Our UEBA product has a wonderful User Interface (UI) written in JavaScript that relies almost entirely on one or more back-end Java services to get its job done. Written using modern and new Java technologies/APIs, our back-end services support our custom analytics, interfacing with our datastore (Elasticsearch), ingesting data, and much more.

What you will be doing

You will work as part of a small (3-5 people) team of back-end Java engineers, alongside several other teams of Java, JavaScript, QA and Platform Engineers . In this role, you will design and write high-level software (largely JVM-based) to analyze streams of data in near-real-time, resolving performance issues, implementing new features and investigating alternate technologies.

Develop, enhance, and maintain our analytics engine
Design and implement features in the streaming analytics pipeline to suit evolving analytic strategies
Work alongside your team to review and test code
Interface with Engineering Leads and other Software Engineers to flesh out requirements and assist in planning
Periodically assist and troubleshoot product-related issues escalated by the product support team
The ideal candidate should...

Be proficient in Java or other JVM-based languages
Have strong experience working with, designing, and implementing distributed systems and understanding of common issues (consistency, reliability, availability, bottlenecks, failure modes, etc)
Be familiar with streaming data workflows and technologies (Kafka, Akka Streams, Spark Streaming, Storm, etc.)
Be driven to investigate and assess new technologies
Function as an individual contributor with minimal guidance
Have Experience with performance testing, monitoring, and profiling complex applications
Some other technologies we use

Building: Jenkins for CI/CD, Maven
Working: JIRA, Confluence, Git, your IDE of choice
Communicating: Slack, Zoom

Salt Lake City, UT
Forcepoint is transforming cybersecurity by focusing on what matters most: understanding people’s intent as they interact with critical data and intellectual property wherever it resides. Our uncompromising systems enable companies to empower employees with unobstructed access to confidential data while protecting intellectual property and simplifying compliance. Based in Austin, Texas, Forcepoint supports more than 20,000 organizations worldwide. For more about Forcepoint, visit www.Forcepoint.com and follow us on Twitter at @ForcepointSec.

We are looking for a Senior Java Engineer with 10+ years of relevant experience to join our analytics team in either our Salt Lake City, Utah or our Baltimore, Maryland office. The primary function of the role is to help design and implement components for the core analytics engine of our platform. You will work alongside engineers, leads, and product owners to plan, scope, and execute and, as a senior member of the team, will be looked towards as a thought leader and technical advocate.

About us

While Forcepoint has many products, the focus for this position is working on our User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) product, which is responsible for collecting and analyzing the digital exhaust that users produce (web logs, communications, logins, etc) in order to detect illegal, unwanted, or harmful behavior.

The Salt Lake City office is located in the Old Mill district in Salt Lake City, in close proximity to Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. The office building has many amenities including: exercise facility, walking/running paths, and covered parking. Within a few minutes walk, employees have access to several restaurants as well as other conveniences that make the location a pleasure to work in.

The Baltimore office is conveniently located in the Federal Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Cross Street Market (which is, sadly, currently being renovated) and only a few blocks from the inner harbor. We are close to many restaurants and stores, and employees in this office receive free, off-street parking. Our office has a large personal reflection room set aside for private use, is very close to the sports stadiums (we plan on taking a day off to watch an Orioles game soon), and its open floor plan helps to support our family-like atmosphere.

Our UEBA product has a wonderful User Interface (UI) written in JavaScript that relies almost entirely on one or more back-end Java services to get its job done.

Salt Lake City, UT
Forcepoint is transforming cybersecurity by focusing on what matters most: understanding people’s intent as they interact with critical data and intellectual property wherever it resides. Our uncompromising systems enable companies to empower employees with unobstructed access to confidential data while protecting intellectual property and simplifying compliance. Based in Austin, Texas, Forcepoint supports more than 20,000 organizations worldwide. For more about Forcepoint, visit www.Forcepoint.com and follow us on Twitter at @ForcepointSec.

We are looking for a Senior Java Engineer with 10+ years of relevant experience to join our analytics team in either our Salt Lake City, Utah or our Baltimore, Maryland office. The primary function of the role is to help design and implement components for the core analytics engine of our platform. You will work alongside engineers, leads, and product owners to plan, scope, and execute and, as a senior member of the team, will be looked towards as a thought leader and technical advocate.

About us

While Forcepoint has many products, the focus for this position is working on our User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) product, which is responsible for collecting and analyzing the digital exhaust that users produce (web logs, communications, logins, etc) in order to detect illegal, unwanted, or harmful behavior.

The Salt Lake City office is located in the Old Mill district in Salt Lake City, in close proximity to Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. The office building has many amenities including: exercise facility, walking/running paths, and covered parking. Within a few minutes walk, employees have access to several restaurants as well as other conveniences that make the location a pleasure to work in.

The Baltimore office is conveniently located in the Federal Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Cross Street Market (which is, sadly, currently being renovated) and only a few blocks from the inner harbor. We are close to many restaurants and stores, and employees in this office receive free, off-street parking. Our office has a large personal reflection room set aside for private use, is very close to the sports stadiums (we plan on taking a day off to watch an Orioles game soon), and its open floor plan helps to support our family-like atmosphere.

Our UEBA product has a wonderful User Interface (UI) written in JavaScript that relies almost entirely on one or more back-end Java services to get its job done. Written using modern and new Java technologies/APIs, our back-end services support our custom analytics, interfacing with our datastore (Elasticsearch), ingesting data, and much more.

What you will be doing

You will work as part of a small (3-5 people) team of back-end Java engineers, alongside several other teams of Java, JavaScript, QA and Platform Engineers . In this role, you will design and write high-level software (largely JVM-based) to analyze streams of data in near-real-time, resolving performance issues, implementing new features and investigating alternate technologies.

Develop, enhance, and maintain our analytics engine
Design and implement features in the streaming analytics pipeline to suit evolving analytic strategies
Work alongside your team to review and test code
Interface with Engineering Leads and other Software Engineers to flesh out requirements and assist in planning
Periodically assist and troubleshoot product-related issues escalated by the product support team
The ideal candidate should...

Be proficient in Java or other JVM-based languages
Have strong experience working with, designing, and implementing distributed systems and understanding of common issues (consistency, reliability, availability, bottlenecks, failure modes, etc)
Be familiar with streaming data workflows and technologies (Kafka, Akka Streams, Spark Streaming, Storm, etc.)
Be driven to investigate and assess new technologies
Function as an individual contributor with minimal guidance
Have Experience with performance testing, monitoring, and profiling complex applications
Some other technologies we use

Building: Jenkins for CI/CD, Maven
Working: JIRA, Confluence, Git, your IDE of choice
Communicating: Slack, Zoom

Forcepoint

Salt Lake City, UT
Forcepoint is transforming cybersecurity by focusing on what matters most: understanding people’s intent as they interact with critical data and intellectual property wherever it resides. Our uncompromising systems enable companies to empower employees with unobstructed access to confidential data while protecting intellectual property and simplifying compliance. Based in Austin, Texas, Forcepoint supports more than 20,000 organizations worldwide. For more about Forcepoint, visit www.Forcepoint.com and follow us on Twitter at @ForcepointSec.

We are looking for a Senior Java Engineer with 10+ years of relevant experience to join our analytics team in either our Salt Lake City, Utah or our Baltimore, Maryland office. The primary function of the role is to help design and implement components for the core analytics engine of our platform. You will work alongside engineers, leads, and product owners to plan, scope, and execute and, as a senior member of the team, will be looked towards as a thought leader and technical advocate.

About us

While Forcepoint has many products, the focus for this position is working on our User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) product, which is responsible for collecting and analyzing the digital exhaust that users produce (web logs, communications, logins, etc) in order to detect illegal, unwanted, or harmful behavior.

The Salt Lake City office is located in the Old Mill district in Salt Lake City, in close proximity to Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. The office building has many amenities including: exercise facility, walking/running paths, and covered parking. Within a few minutes walk, employees have access to several restaurants as well as other conveniences that make the location a pleasure to work in.

The Baltimore office is conveniently located in the Federal Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Cross Street Market (which is, sadly, currently being renovated) and only a few blocks from the inner harbor. We are close to many restaurants and stores, and employees in this office receive free, off-street parking. Our office has a large personal reflection room set aside for private use, is very close to the sports stadiums (we plan on taking a day off to watch an Orioles game soon), and its open floor plan helps to support our family-like atmosphere.

Our UEBA product has a wonderful User Interface (UI) written in JavaScript that relies almost entirely on one or more back-end Java services to get its job done. Written using modern and new Java technologies/APIs, our back-end services support our custom analytics, interfacing with our datastore (Elasticsearch), ingesting data, and much more.

What you will be doing

You will work as part of a small (3-5 people) team of back-end Java engineers, alongside several other teams of Java, JavaScript, QA and Platform Engineers . In this role, you will design and write high-level software (largely JVM-based) to analyze streams of data in near-real-time, resolving performance issues, implementing new features and investigating alternate technologies.

Develop, enhance, and maintain our analytics engine
Design and implement features in the streaming analytics pipeline to suit evolving analytic strategies
Work alongside your team to review and test code
Interface with Engineering Leads and other Software Engineers to flesh out requirements and assist in planning
Periodically assist and troubleshoot product-related issues escalated by the product support team
The ideal candidate should...

Be proficient in Java or other JVM-based languages
Have strong experience working with, designing, and implementing distributed systems and understanding of common issues (consistency, reliability, availability, bottlenecks, failure modes, etc)
Be familiar with streaming data workflows and technologies (Kafka, Akka Streams, Spark Streaming, Storm, etc.)
Be driven to investigate and assess new technologies
Function as an individual contributor with minimal guidance
Have Experience with performance testing, monitoring, and profiling complex applications
Some other technologies we use

Building: Jenkins for CI/CD, Maven
Working: JIRA, Confluence, Git, your IDE of choice
Communicating: Slack, Zoom

Salt Lake City, UT
It takes powerful technology to connect our brands and partners with an audience of 1 billion. Nearly half of Verizon Media employees are building the code and platforms that help us achieve that. Whether you’re looking to write mobile app code, engineer the servers behind our massive ad tech stacks, or develop algorithms to help us process 4 trillion data points a day, what you do here will have a huge impact on our business—and the world. Want in? As Verizon’s media unit, our brands like Yahoo, TechCrunch and HuffPost help people stay informed and entertained, communicate and transact, while creating new ways for advertisers and partners to connect. With technologies like XR, AI, machine-learning, and 5G, we’re transforming media for tomorrow, too. We're creators and coders, dreamers and doers creating what's next in content, advertising and technology.
The Role:
We're looking for people who are simultaneously passionate and laid back - we take our work very seriously, but are (IMO) pretty fun-loving and good-natured. Our culture is very open and all technical decisions are up for debate and discussion; we try to avoid mandates and instead prefer to do things because there is solid reasoning behind them. When we discuss ideas everyone keeps it polite, but you do need to be able to defend an idea without taking offense. Similarly, we like people who are confident enough to take some calculated risks, but we are less interested in dealing with big egos. We want people who aren't embarrassed to ask for help when they know they're in a rut, but who also don't need to be micromanaged. In many ways, personality is as important as technical skill set.

REQUIREMENTS
Qualifications:
Backend: Proficient in Python, Django, Node.js, etc…

Frontend: Experienced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Angular, Ember, or React a plus.

Experience: 4+ years experience in software development

Education: Degree in Computer Science or related or equivalent work experience

Database: SQL experience (specifically Postgres) and MongoDB a plus

Cloud: Experience writing microservices deployed with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud a plus.

Tools: Jira, Git, Slack

Location: Our office is located in Sandy, Utah but the position is open for remote applicants.

Oath is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to, and will not be discriminated against based on, age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, disability or any other protected category. Oath is dedicated to providing an accessible environment for all candidates during the application process and for employees during their employment. Please let us know if you need a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or participate in the application process.

Currently work for Oath? Please apply on our internal career site.
